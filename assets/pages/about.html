        <p>
          I am web developer with the passion to keep learning. I like to code
          and problem-solve technology-related issues. Overall, one of my
          biggest strengths is adaptability. And I truly value work ethic and
          dependability, not only for myself, but from employers and co-workers
          as well. Overall, I am looking for a career path that aligns with my
          values while fostering growth and innovation.
